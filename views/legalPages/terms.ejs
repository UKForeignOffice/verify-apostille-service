    <h2 class="font-medium">Keeping your data secure</h2>

    <h2 class="font-medium">Disclosing your information</h2>

    <p>If you complete a legalisation application, the personal data you have submitted will be held securely as a historical record of your application. The financial information you have supplied will be held for 18 months.</p>

    <h2 class="font-medium">Data Protection Act 1998</h2>
    <p>The Foreign and Commonwealth Office holds and uses data for purposes notified to the Information Commissioner under the Data Protection Act 1998 (which may be viewed on the <a href="http://www.ico.gov.uk/"  rel="external" target="_blank">Information Commissioner's Office<span class="visually-hidden"> opens in new window</span></a> website).
